# LinkedList-in-C
in this project we will discover linkedlist(single & double) and the main implementation:
*there is a lot of comments to explain evre thing*

•insert
•create node
•find
•findPrevious
•display
•sizeOf
•delete
•deleteList 

and some questions :

• Question 1) Write a function that takes two sorted linked lists
and return true if the lists are disjoin lists (meaning they have no common elements). Use iterations to solve this question.

• Question 2) Write a recursive function that takes two sorted linked lists 
and return true if the lists are disjoin lists (meaning they have no common elements). Your algorithm should be O(n).

• Question 3) Write a function to reverse a given doubly linked list.

• Question 4) Write a function called concat() that receives two lists and append the first one to the second.
 
• Question 5) Given a singly linked list, write a function to swap elements pairwise.
For example, if the linked list is 1->2->3->4->5 
then the function should change it to 2->1->4->3->5,
and if the linked list is 1->2->3->4->5->6 then the function should change it to 2->1->4->3->6->5.

• Question 6) Write a function called RemoveDuplicates() that takes a 
list sorted in increasing order and deletes any duplicate nodes from the list.

• Question 7) Write an iterative Reverse() function that reverses 
a list by rearranging all the .next pointers and the head pointer.
